# Discord-RPG-Bot
A Discord bot with a toolset to allow it to perform basic upkeep in an RPG, such as rolling dice and drawing cards. 

Requires the installation of discord.py, which can be gotten through pip.  

Note that you will have to run it directly through your command line via py-3 (filename).py, with (filename) being whatever you call the file. 

Also note that I wrote the first draft of this bot a month or two prior to a large update to the discord.py package, and thus not all of the commands function as they should. 

Completed goals thus far: 

1. Actually remembered how to run this script. 
2. Updated bot-messaging commands to actually run instead of throwing an error. 

Current goals:

1: Update code to gel with updates to discord.py. 
2: Bug/error fixes, troubleshooting, etc. 
3: Get player stats involved. HP, basic DND stats, etc.
